# Multipass

Multipass is a universal open source protocol designed to facilitate frictionless user verification and transparent end user verification flow between platforms.

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, user may have numerous accounts across different platforms, each requiring them to verify their identity. Whenever someone tries to find same user on different platforms, they do not have united way to query for the user. This leads to a fragmented user experience, where users are forced to repeatedly verify their identity on different platforms, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming.

## Features

- **Universal Protocol**: Multipass is a universal protocol that enables platforms to seamlessly verify users across different platforms.
- **Mutated usernames**: Multipass supports that many platforms allow users to change their usernames. Multipass supports this by allowing platforms to query user by either immutable id or mutable username.
- **Reverse Lookup**: Multipass supports reverse lookup, which allows platforms to query for the user by their Multipass ID.
- **Eth Address Verification**: Multipass supports verification of user's Ethereum address.
- **Cross Platform Lookup**: Multipass supports cross platform lookup, which allows platforms to query for the user by their Multipass ID across different platforms.
